Ratago is a (mostly-compliant) implementation of an XSLT 1.0 processor written in Go and released under an MIT license.

Currently it should be seen as experimental - it lacks full compliance with the spec. It has been run successfully on a number of scripts of moderate complexity as of the 0.4-pre release.

The test suite is derived from the test suite used by the libxslt library written by Daniel Veillard. See http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/ for details on libxslt.

Installation
----

For MacOS:
```sh
# Need pkg-config, see https://stackoverflow.com/a/36794452/700471
brew install pkg-config 
# Need libxml2 source, see https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/68#issuecomment-120301708
brew install libxml2
sudo ln -s /usr/local/opt/libxml2/include/libxml2/libxml /usr/local/include/libxml 
# Install with Go Modules
GO111MODULE=on go get github.com/jbowtie/ratago
```

Example Usage
----

```sh
ratago -indent transform.xslt data.xml > result.xml
```

TODO
----

There are several tasks remaining to reach full compliance. Until these tasks are complete the API is subject to change.

* Implement xsl:decimal-format and format-number.
* Ensure that errors are properly progogated in Go fashion.
